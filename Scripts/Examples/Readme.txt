This is an example object using a script component with code written in Python.

This requires the python scripting engine to be installed and registered on the
user computer.

ActivePython has an installer that does everything for you. You can find the
latest version here: http://www.activestate.com/activepython/

Simply install it and then load the object.

Note: the python component is already included in the object as a custom file,
but I also added it directly inside the zip for easier viewing.
